"Hi, I'm *Kaustubh Shinde*, As an Assistant Professor at Sinhgad Institute of Technology Science, I have been teaching a variety of computer science courses, including Computer Networks, Software Defined Networks, Information and Cyber Security, and High-Performance Computing. I earned my ME in Computer Networks from Savitribai Phule Pune University and my BE in Computer Science Engineering from Solapur University.

Aside from teaching, I am an active mentor and single point of contact for several programs. I have mentored numerous students for the Google Cloud Career Readiness Program's Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) track, helping them explore cloud computing as a career path and become Google Cloud Ready. Additionally, I am a part of the Institute Innovation Cell and have organized over 20 technical workshops, inviting industry experts to share their experiences with the community.

I have also conducted hands-on sessions for Network Routing Protocols for the Cyber Shikshaa Program, an initiative of DSCI and Microsoft Training Partner Quick Heal Technologies, and guided several undergraduate projects, including DISC Diffusion Antibody Sensitivity Testing using Image Processing and Machine Learning, Agricultural Production Optimization Engine, and E-Suraksha.

Furthermore, I hold several certifications in Architecting with Google Compute Engine, Networking in Google Cloud, Introduction to Forensic Science and Digital Cyber Forensics, and Network Security from NIT, Nagpur, and NITTR, Kolkata.

I possess expertise in programming languages such as Python, C#, .Net, and CCNA, and networking tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, GNS3, NAM, and Mininet.
